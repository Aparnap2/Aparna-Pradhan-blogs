## Steps to Build a Niche-Specific Vertical AI Agent

Building a specialized AI agent might seem intimidating, but with the right tools, it’s simple. Follow this structured guide to get started.
Building niche-specific vertical AI agents involves creating specialized systems tailored to particular domains or industries. Leveraging tools like Hugging Face's SmolAgents library and models such as Gemini can streamline this process. Here's a detailed roadmap, workflow, setup, and a real-world implemented example to guide you through the process.

**1. Blueprint Roadmap**

- **Define Objectives**: Clearly articulate the specific tasks and goals your AI agent should accomplish within the chosen niche.

- **Select Appropriate Models**: Choose language models that align with your domain requirements. Hugging Face's SmolAgents library and models like Gemini are suitable options.

- **Integrate Domain-Specific Tools**: Identify and incorporate tools pertinent to your niche to enhance the agent's capabilities.

- **Develop and Test**: Build the agent, conduct thorough testing, and refine its performance based on feedback.

**2. Workflow**

- **Data Collection**: Gather domain-specific data to fine-tune the language model, enhancing its relevance and accuracy.

- **Model Training**: Train the model using the collected data to adapt it to the specific nuances of your niche.

- **Agent Development**: Utilize the SmolAgents library to create the AI agent, integrating the trained model and necessary tools.

- **Testing and Validation**: Rigorously test the agent's performance, ensuring it meets the defined objectives and performs reliably.

- **Deployment**: Deploy the agent within your operational environment, monitoring its performance and making adjustments as needed.

**3. Setup**

- **Install Necessary Libraries**: Begin by installing the required libraries, including SmolAgents and any other dependencies.

  ```bash
  pip install smolagents
  ```

- **Import Modules**: Import the essential components from the SmolAgents library.

  ```python
  from smolagents import CodeAgent, DuckDuckGoSearchTool, HfApiModel
  ```

- **Initialize the Language Model**: Set up the language model that will power your agent.

  ```python
  model = HfApiModel(model_id="describeai/gemini-small")
  ```

- **Define the Agent and Tools**: Create an instance of `CodeAgent` and specify the tools it can utilize.

  ```python
  agent = CodeAgent(
      tools=[DuckDuckGoSearchTool()],
      model=model
  )
  ```

**4. Real Use Case: Financial Data Analysis Agent**

*Scenario*: Develop an AI agent that provides real-time financial data analysis for specific stocks.

- **Integrate Financial Data Retrieval Tool**: Incorporate a tool to fetch current stock prices.

  ```python
  from smolagents import tool

  @tool
  def get_stock_price(ticker: str) -> float:
      import yfinance as yf
      stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)
      return stock.history(period="1d")['Close'].iloc[-1]
  ```

- **Create the Agent**: Define the agent with the integrated financial tool.

  ```python
  agent = CodeAgent(
      tools=[get_stock_price],
      model=model
  )
  ```

- **Execute a Task**: Use the agent to retrieve and analyze stock information.

  ```python
  response = agent.run("Analyze the current stock price of AAPL and provide investment insights.")
  print(response)
  ```

**5. Best Practices**

- **Security Measures**: Ensure secure code execution to prevent vulnerabilities. SmolAgents provides a custom `LocalPythonInterpreter` designed with security measures to safely execute code generated by the agent. 

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage exceptions and maintain agent stability.

- **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly update the model and tools to adapt to changing domain requirements and data.
